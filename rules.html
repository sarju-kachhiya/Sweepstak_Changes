                <p><strong><br>RELEASE:</strong></p>

                <p>Company, SCA, each of their legal representatives, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, agencies and their respective members, officers, directors, employees and agents, are not responsible for lost, interrupted or unavailable network server
                    or other connections, miscommunications, failed telephone or computer transmissions or technical failure, lost online entries, jumbled, scrambled or misdirected transmissions, or other error of any kind, whether human, mechanical or
                    electronic. By entering the Promotion, each contestant agrees to release and hold harmless Company, SCA, each of their legal representatives, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, agencies and their respective members, officers, directors,
                    employees and agents from and against any and all liability for any injuries, loss or damage of any kind arising from, or in connection with, the Promotion including, but not limited to, liability arising from copyright infringement,
                    improper use of likeness, personal injury, death, damages or monetary loss. Restrictions, conditions and limitations apply. By entering the Promotion, each contestant further agrees that, in the event that there is any conflict or
                    other inconsistency between the Rules and any advertisements, promotional or marketing materials, e-mail messages or other announcements relevant to the Promotion, these Rules will govern.</p>

                <p><strong><br>CHOICE OF LAW:</strong></p>

                <p>Any disputes arising out of or related to the Promotion shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflict of law principles). Should a dispute arise concerning the Promotion,
                    the parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before the American Arbitration Association in New York, New York, in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration rules of the American Arbitration
                    Association. Should a dispute arise concerning the Promotion, the terms and conditions of these Rules or the breach of same by any party hereto, you may commence a formal dispute proceeding by completing and submitting an Initial Dispute
                    Notice to us which can be found. We may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer after receiving your Initial Dispute Notice ("Final Settlement Offer"). If we provide you with a Final Settlement Offer and you do
                    not accept it, or we cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute, you can submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties, in your county
                    of residence, by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, which is available . For claims of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions.
                    If the arbitrator awards you relief that is greater than our Final Settlement Offer, then we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration and, if you retained an attorney to represent you
                    in connection with the arbitration, we will reimburse any reasonable attorneys’ fees that your attorney accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration. Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive to
                    the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any party from: (a) seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending
                    an outcome in arbitration; and/or (b) pursuing the matter in small claims court rather than arbitration. Although we may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an
                    award from you unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.</p>

                <p>To the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against Company and/or its employees, officers, directors, members,
                    representatives and/or assigns. You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in the suit. You agree to pay the attorney’s fees and court costs that Company incurs in seeking such
                    relief. This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (i) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in
                    binding arbitration as provided above; and (ii) is an independent agreement. You may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you submit your
                    first entry into the Promotion, using the contact information provided on the Website.</p>

                <p><strong><br>SEVERABILITY/ENTIRE AGREEMENT:</strong></p>

                <p>Should any part of these Rules be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. To the extent that Company's Privacy Policy
                    and/or Terms and Conditions are in conflict or inconsistent with these Rules as they pertain to the Promotion, these Rules shall take precedence.</p>

                <p><strong><br>DISQUALIFICATION:</strong></p>

                <p>Persons found tampering with or abusing any aspect of the Promotion, as solely determined by the judges, will be disqualified. If disqualified for any of the above reasons, Company reserves the right to terminate contestant's eligibility
                    to participate in the Promotion. In the event that any portion of the Promotion is compromised by virus, bugs, non-authorized human intervention or other causes beyond the control of Company which, in the sole opinion of Company, corrupts,
                    or impairs the administration, security, fairness or proper determination of the Promotion, Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate the Promotion or any part of the Promotion, or any combination
                    of the above. Company, SCA, each of their respective legal representatives, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, agencies and their respective members, officers, directors, employees and agents are not responsible for any problem with
                    entries generated by computer hardware or software malfunction, error or failure, whatever the cause. Company's sole responsibility for any irregular entry is replacement with another entry in a subsequent drawing. If a potential winning
                    entry is made by Internet or other computer entry, that potential winner may be required to provide Company with proof that the potential winner is the authorized account holder of the electronic mail address associated with the potential
                    winning entry.</p>

                <p><strong><br>INDEMNIFICATION:</strong></p>

                <p>You agree to release, indemnify and hold Company, SCA, each of their respective parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, and their respective members, officers, directors, employees, agents, co-branders and/or other partners, harmless from
                    and against any and all claims, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and settlement costs), damages, suits, costs, demands and/or judgments whatsoever, made by any third party due to or arising out of: (a) your use
                    of the Promotion and/or the Website; (b) your breach of these Rules; and/or (c) your violation of any rights of another individual and/or entity. The provisions of this paragraph are for the benefit of Company, SCA, each of their respective
                    parents, subsidiaries and/or affiliates, and their respective members, officers, directors, employees, agents, shareholders, licensors, suppliers and/or attorneys. Each of these individuals and entities shall have the right to assert
                    and enforce these provisions directly against you on its own behalf.</p>

                <p><strong><br>LEGAL WARNING:</strong></p>

                <p>Any attempt by any individual, whether or not a contestant, to damage, destroy, tamper with or vandalize the Website, or otherwise interfere with the operation of the Promotion, is a violation of criminal and civil law and Company will
                    diligently pursue any and all remedies in this regard against any offending individual or entity to the fullest extent permissible by law and in equity.</p>
